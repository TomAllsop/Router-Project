# Router-Project
Having to send my housemates the same picture from excel on the cleaning router every week was getting tiring.
So I came up with a program that automatically reads an excel (csv) file and sends my housemates an email with what their job is that week.

It works with a python library called smtplib. It also uses Task Scheduler. Task Scheduler can run the program when my computer is on without me having to do anything.
